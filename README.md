# Semi-supervised segmentation and tracking algorithms for [cell segmentation](http://celltrackingchallenge.net/)

We present a novel weakly supervised 3D nuclei segmentation method that consists of deep learning based nuclei detection, watershed segmentation, and a boundary correction algorithm using supervoxels. Additionally, we present a simple and efficient graph-based tracking algorithm utilizing relative nuclei location information extracted from the adjacency graph. 


For more details about our methodology, please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13343).

The performance of our proposed method on CTC 2020 dataset is shown in the following table:

|Dataset|DET|SEG|TRA|OP_CSB|OP_CTB|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Fluo-N3DH-CE|0.927|0.705|0.895|0.816|0.800|
|Fluo-C3DL-MDA231|0.839|0.545|0.795|0.692|0.670|

## How to run

The command 

`./Fluo-MDA231.sh indir outdirseg outdirtrack`

runs the segmentation and tracking pipeline on all tif stacks in `indir` and saves the label masks in `outdirseg` and `outdirtrack` respectively.


## Example usage


`./Fluo-MDA231.sh ./01 ./01_RES_SEG ./01_RES_TRACK`
